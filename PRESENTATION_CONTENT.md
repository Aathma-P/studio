### **Slide 2: Introduction**

*   **Title:** What is GROC_AR?
*   **Content:**
    *   GROC_AR is a modern web application designed to revolutionize the in-store shopping experience.
    *   It acts as a smart shopping assistant that helps users create and manage shopping lists.
    *   Its core feature is guiding users through a supermarket to find their items in the most efficient way possible using three distinct navigation modes: a 2D map, a simple compass, and an immersive Augmented Reality (AR) view.
    *   The app leverages Artificial Intelligence to visually recognize products on the shelf, confirming that the user has found the correct item.

### **Slide 3: Problem Statement**

*   **Title:** The Challenge of Modern Supermarkets
*   **Content:**
    *   Large supermarkets can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate, especially for new customers or those looking for specific, less common items.
    *   Inefficient wandering leads to wasted time and a frustrating shopping experience. A typical shopper can spend a significant portion of their visit just looking for items.
    *   Forgetting items or not having a clear plan can lead to multiple trips through the same aisles.
*   **Our Solution:** GROC_AR directly addresses this by providing the single most efficient route to get all items on a user's list, saving time and reducing stress.

### **Slide 4: Application Domain**

*   **Title:** Our Focus Area
*   **Content:**
    *   **Primary Domain:** Retail Technology & In-Store Experience.
    *   **Sub-domains:**
        *   **Indoor Navigation:** Providing GPS-like guidance where GPS doesn't work.
        *   **Augmented Reality (AR):** Overlaying digital information (navigation arrows) onto the real-world view.
        *   **Applied Artificial Intelligence:** Using AI for practical tasks like object recognition (product scanning).
        *   **Mobile-First Web Applications:** Creating a seamless experience accessible from any modern smartphone without needing to install a native app.

### **Slide 5: Methodology**

*   **Title:** How It Works: The Core Logic
*   **Content:**
    1.  **Store Digitization:** The store layout, aisle structure, and the exact location of every product are defined in a grid-based data structure.
    2.  **Route Optimization (The Greedy Approach):**
        *   When a user has a list of items, we first calculate the shortest path from the user's current location (starting at the entrance) to *every* item on their list.
        *   The app selects the nearest item and adds it to an ordered route.
        *   This process repeats from the location of the just-added item until all items are in the route. This creates the most efficient shopping order.
    3.  **Pathfinding (A* Algorithm):**
        *   To find the path between any two points (e.g., from the entrance to the first item), we use the A\* (A-star) search algorithm.
        *   A\* is an industry-standard algorithm perfect for grid-based maps. It finds the shortest path while intelligently avoiding obstacles like shelves and walls.
    4.  **AI-Powered Item Recognition:**
        *   When in AR mode, the user can point their camera at a shelf.
        *   The app captures an image and sends it to a Google Gemini vision model with a specific prompt: "Is [item name] in this image?"
        *   The AI analyzes the image and returns a "true" or "false" answer, allowing the app to confirm if the item has been found.

### **Slide 6: UI Design**

*   **Title:** Designing an Intuitive Experience
*   **Content:**
    *   **Mobile-First Approach:** The user interface was designed primarily for smartphones, ensuring large, tappable buttons and a layout that works perfectly in a vertical orientation.
    *   **Component-Based Architecture:** We used **ShadCN UI**, a collection of pre-built React components, to create a consistent and professional look and feel throughout the application. This includes buttons, cards, dialogs, and more.
    *   **Clean & Minimalist:** The design prioritizes clarity. We used a simple color palette with green as the primary color to create a fresh, positive feel. There is minimal clutter, allowing the user to focus on their primary task: shopping.
    *   **Themed with Tailwind CSS:** Styling and theming (including colors, spacing, and fonts) were managed using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and responsive UI development.

### **Slide 7: Technology Used**

*   **Title:** The Tech Stack
*   **Content:**
    *   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (with React) - For building a fast, server-rendered web application.
    *   **Language:** TypeScript - For adding static types to JavaScript, which helps prevent bugs and improves code quality.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI - For modern, responsive, and component-driven design.
    *   **Artificial Intelligence:** Genkit (with Google Gemini Pro Vision) - For the AI-powered product recognition feature. Genkit provides the framework to easily define and call the AI model.
    *   **Pathfinding Algorithm:** A\* (A-Star) - A classic and highly efficient algorithm implemented in TypeScript for route calculation.
    *   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) - For managing all application state, such as the shopping list and the current navigation view.
